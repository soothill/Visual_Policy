```bash
# Using your default browser
open index.html

# Or on Linux
xdg-open index.html

# Or on Windows
start index.html
```

```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Choose a Template** (optional): Click one of the quick template buttons to load pre-configured settings
2. **Enter Bucket Name**: Specify your S3 bucket name (required)
3. **Configure Policy**:
   - Select Effect (Allow/Deny)
   - Check desired actions (GetObject, PutObject, etc.)
   - Specify resource path within the bucket
4. **Generate Policy**: Click the "Generate Policy" button
5. **Edit if Needed**: Click directly in the policy output to manually edit the JSON
6. **Copy or Download**: Use the action buttons to copy or download your policy

### Manual Editing

After generating a policy, you can click directly in the policy output area to manually edit the JSON. This is useful for:
- Fine-tuning specific values
- Adding advanced conditions
- Making quick adjustments without regenerating
- Learning by experimenting with the policy structure

**Tips:**
- Click the "Validate JSON" button after editing to ensure your JSON is valid
- Use proper JSON formatting (quotes, commas, brackets)
- The Copy and Download buttons will use your edited version

### Examples

#### Public Read Access for Static Website

1. Click "Public Read Access" template
2. Change bucket name to your bucket
3. Click "Generate Policy"
4. Copy the generated policy to your S3 bucket policy settings

#### Private Access for Specific IAM User

1. Click "Private Read/Write" template
2. Update bucket name
3. Click "Generate Policy"

### Bucket Name Validation

The application validates bucket names in real-time as you type, ensuring they comply with AWS S3 naming standards. The validation checks:

**AWS S3 Bucket Naming Rules:**
- ✓ Length between 3 and 63 characters
- ✓ Only lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-)
- ✓ Must begin and end with a letter or number
- ✓ Cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- ✓ Cannot start with `xn--` prefix
- ✓ Cannot end with `-s3alias` suffix
- ✓ Cannot contain two adjacent periods (..)
- ✓ Cannot have a period adjacent to a hyphen (.- or -.)
- ✓ Cannot contain uppercase letters
- ✓ Cannot contain underscores (_)

**Visual Feedback:**
- 🟢 Green border = Valid bucket name
- 🔴 Red border = Invalid bucket name
- Specific error messages shown below the input field

**Examples:**
- ✅ Valid: `my-bucket-name`, `example.bucket.123`, `prod-data-2024`
- ❌ Invalid: `MyBucket` (uppercase), `my_bucket` (underscore), `my..bucket` (adjacent periods)

### Principal Configuration

**Note:** Principal specification is currently **hidden** in the Impossible Cloud Bucket Policy Generator as explicit principal configuration in bucket policies is not currently supported by Impossible Cloud's S3-compatible API.

Bucket policies generated by this tool will work without explicit principal definitions. Access control should be managed through:
- **IAM policies** attached to users and groups
- **Bucket policies** that define which actions are allowed on the bucket
- **Access keys** and credentials managed through the Impossible Cloud console

### S3 Actions Selection (Impossible Cloud Compatible)

The application provides **33+ S3 actions** organized into 8 categories for easy selection. All actions are compatible with Impossible Cloud's S3 API. Click any category header to expand/collapse it.

**Action Categories:**

1. **📄 Object Operations** (7 actions)
   - GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject, GetObjectAttributes, GetObjectTagging, PutObjectTagging, DeleteObjectTagging

2. **🗂️ Bucket Operations** (6 actions)
   - ListBucket, ListBucketVersions, ListBucketMultipartUploads, GetBucketLocation, GetBucketVersioning, PutBucketVersioning

3. **🔐 Bucket Policy & CORS** (6 actions)
   - GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, DeleteBucketPolicy, GetBucketCORS, PutBucketCORS, DeleteBucketCORS

4. **🔄 Object Versioning** (6 actions)
   - GetObjectVersion, DeleteObjectVersion, GetObjectVersionAttributes, GetObjectVersionTagging, PutObjectVersionTagging, DeleteObjectVersionTagging

5. **📤 Multipart Upload** (2 actions)
   - AbortMultipartUpload, ListMultipartUploadParts

6. **🏷️ Bucket Tagging** (3 actions)
   - GetBucketTagging, PutBucketTagging, DeleteBucketTagging

7. **🔒 Object Lock & Compliance** (3 actions)
   - GetObjectLockConfiguration, PutObjectLockConfiguration, BypassGovernanceRetention

8. **🚀 Advanced** (1 action)
   - s3:* (all S3 actions)

**Usage Tips:**
- Object Operations category is expanded by default for quick access to common actions
- Other categories start collapsed to keep the interface clean
- All actions are compatible with Impossible Cloud's S3 API
- Select `s3:*` in the Advanced category to grant all S3 permissions
- Use the "Additional Actions" textarea for any actions not in the list

### Advanced Features

#### Adding Custom Actions

In the "Additional Actions" textarea, enter one action per line:
```
s3:GetBucketLocation
s3:PutObjectAcl
s3:GetObjectVersion
```

#### Using Conditions

Add IAM policy conditions in the "Condition" field using JSON format:
```json
{
  "StringLike": {
    "s3:prefix": ["documents/*"]
  }
}
```

Or IP address restrictions:
```json
{
  "IpAddress": {
    "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
  }
}
```

### Policy Validation

The built-in validator performs comprehensive checks to ensure your policy is valid and follows AWS best practices. Click the "✓ Validate JSON" button to check your policy.

**What the Validator Checks:**

**Errors (must be fixed):**
- ✓ Valid JSON syntax
- ✓ Required fields: `Version` and `Statement`
- ✓ Version must be "2012-10-17" or "2008-10-17"
- ✓ Statement must be a non-empty array
- ✓ Each statement must have `Effect` (Allow/Deny)
- ✓ Each statement must have `Action` or `NotAction`
- ✓ Each statement must have `Resource` or `NotResource`
- ✓ Effect must be exactly "Allow" or "Deny"
- ✓ Action format validation (service:action)
- ✓ Resource ARN format (must start with `arn:aws:s3:::`)
- ✓ Bucket name length and format
- ✓ Condition operators must be valid IAM operators
- ✓ Sid must be alphanumeric only

**Warnings (best practices):**
- ⚠️ Using deprecated Version "2008-10-17"
- ⚠️ Principal field present (not supported by Impossible Cloud - will be ignored)
- ⚠️ Non-S3 actions in S3 bucket policy
- ⚠️ Unknown S3 actions
- ⚠️ Unknown or custom fields in policy

**Example Validation Output:**

```
✅ Policy is valid and follows AWS best practices!
```

Or with warnings:
```
⚠️ Policy is valid but has warnings:
• Statement[0]: Principal field is not supported by Impossible Cloud and will be ignored
• Version "2008-10-17" is deprecated. Use "2012-10-17"
```

## Common S3 Actions

- `s3:GetObject` - Read/download objects
- `s3:PutObject` - Upload/write objects
- `s3:DeleteObject` - Delete objects
- `s3:ListBucket` - List bucket contents
- `s3:GetBucketLocation` - Get bucket region
- `s3:PutObjectAcl` - Modify object ACLs

## Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

- **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions required
- **Use Conditions**: Add conditions to restrict access by IP, time, or other factors
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update your bucket policies
- **IAM Access Control**: Manage access through Impossible Cloud IAM policies and access keys
- **Enable Encryption**: Consider adding conditions that require encrypted uploads

## Applying the Generated Policy

### Using Impossible Cloud Console

1. Log in to Impossible Cloud Console
2. Navigate to your storage buckets
3. Select your bucket
4. Go to "Permissions" or "Bucket Policy" section
5. Paste your generated policy
6. Save changes

### Using AWS CLI (S3-Compatible)

Configure your AWS CLI to use Impossible Cloud endpoints, then:
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME --policy file://bucket-policy.json --endpoint-url https://your-impossible-cloud-endpoint
```
